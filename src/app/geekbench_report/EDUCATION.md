# Teaching notes

The Geekbench pipeline is a small example project for demonstrating key data engineering concepts.

Use it to highlight topics such as:

- Building web scrapers that handle pagination and interruptions.
- Loading incremental data sets into PostgreSQL using pandas and SQLAlchemy.
- Maintaining dimension tables and removing duplicate records.

You can extend the scripts to schedule regular sync jobs or to build analytical reports.
